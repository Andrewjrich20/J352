<p>Aviation is widely known to be the safest form of travel. Whether that be commercial jets, military fighters, or even a propeller plane that can only fit two people.

However, in 2025, aviation accidents seem to be popping up on news feeds every couple of days. Are these numbers normal, and if not, why has there been an increase in fatal aviation accidents in 2025?

This conversation was sparked in late January when a regional jet crashed while approaching Reagan International Airport at night. The jet collided with an Army Blackhawk helicopter that was doing a training mission. The jet, as well as the helicopter, crashed into the Potomac River, killing the 67 passengers and crew on board the jet as well as the 3 military personnel on the helicopter.

A major airliner being involved in a crash like this had not been seen in many years in the United States. Before it, the most recent crash involving a US airliner was in 2009. It made sense that this crash would spark a conversation about the safety of commercial jets in this country.</p>
