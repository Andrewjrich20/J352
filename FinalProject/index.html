<p>By: Andrew Rich - WASHINGTON D.C.</p>

<p>Aviation is widely known to be the safest form of travel. Whether that be commercial jets, military fighters, or even a propeller plane that can only fit two people.</p>

<p>However, in 2025, aviation accidents seem to be popping up on news feeds every couple of days. Are these numbers normal, and if not, why has there been an increase in fatal aviation accidents in 2025?</p>

<p>This conversation was sparked in late January when a regional jet crashed while approaching Reagan International Airport at night. The jet collided with an Army Blackhawk helicopter that was doing a training mission. The jet, as well as the helicopter, crashed into the Potomac River, killing the 67 passengers and crew on board the jet as well as the 3 military personnel on the helicopter.</p>

<p>A major airliner being involved in a crash like this had not been seen in many years in the United States. Before it, the most recent crash involving a US airliner was in 2009. It made sense that this crash would spark a conversation about the safety of commercial jets in this country.</p>

<h2>Worldwide Aviation Accidents</h2>

<p>So far, in 2025, the NTSB has reported 44 fatal aviation accidents. From those 44 incidents, 151 people have been killed. If this same pace continues for the rest of the year, there will have been approximately 132 fatal aviation accidents by the end of 2025. With this number being much lower than in years past, it begs the question as to why this conversation about aviation safety was sparked. </p>

<p>While the major airliner crash that occurred in January is definitely a contributor, there must be other factors at play. Just a couple of weeks later, an airliner landed at Toronto Pearson Airport and rolled over as it skidded down the runway. While no one was injured in this incident, it made huge national news. Media coverage of these aviation incidents was amplifying the problem. </p>

<p>Another suggestion as to what may be causing these incidents is the issue of air traffic control shortages. According to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the US is about 3,000 air traffic controllers short of its target.It has been speculated that a miscommunication between air traffic controllers, the Black Hawk helicopter, and the jet was partially to blame for the fatal crash that occurred in January. </p>

<p>According to Chris Wilbanks, vice president of mission support at the FAA, “Less than 10% of the people that apply for the job actually make it to the academy and then graduate to go out in the field.”</p>

<p>As a result of the grueling job that being an air traffic controller is, those who hold those jobs are required to retire by the age of 56. However, due to these shortages, many air traffic controllers are forced to work six-day workweeks.</p> 


<p>Despite the shortage and the vast media coverage that recent aviation accidents are getting, flying still remains the safest form of travel, by far. A professor of statistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Arnold Barnett, urges Americans to realize the progress aviation safety has made in the last half century.</p>

<p>Aviation accidents, especially fatal ones, are extremely unlikely, and flying is consistently the safest form of travel. The major crash that occurred in D.C. in January put everyone on high alert. Following that, even smaller aviation incidents received major news coverage, sparking the debate that followed regarding aviation safety. </p>

<p>While there are aspects of the aviation industry that could benefit from stricter scrutiny, aviation deaths are such a small piece of the pie in comparison with deaths by other modes of transportation. Aviation is one of the marvels of modern engineering and its benefits have been felt by society for decades. Flying is extremely safe and these incidents are rare to say the least. </p>
