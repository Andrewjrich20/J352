<p>NHL hockey goes through periods of time where the amount of goals being scored per game can fluctuate. Obviously, technology changes have made the game very different. For example, goalie equipment is considerably different than what it was in the 80s and 90s. Also, new stick technology has allowed players to better customize their stick to their strengths. How flexible the stick is, what kind of curve it has and other aspects like kick-point have revolutionized how players score goals. </p>

<p>I wanted to look at the average amount of goals scored for every NHL season going back to the 1967-68 season when the league expanded from the original 6 teams to 12 total teams. These numbers only take the regular season into account and exclude playoff goals. Looking at this data was very interesting. NHL average scoring was highest around the early 1980s. This is when goaltenders played very differently then they do now and their equipment was much smaller than modern day pads and helmets. There was a "dead puck era" in the late 90s early 2000s. However, NHL scoring is on the rise again over the last handful of years. With talent at an all time high and technology assisting that talent, I predict that goal scoring will continue to go up over the next several years.</p>
